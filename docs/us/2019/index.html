                    <h1><a href="#intro">JOIN US!</a></h1>
                    <p>The US Haxe Summit is a three day event which will take place in Seattle in May 2019. It is the main Haxe Community Event in the US and a great meeting spot for the people who create Haxe, people who work with it or people who are new to Haxe and want to explore it.</p>

                    <p>We will have a mix of presentations and workshops about topics ranging from game development with Haxe to things you can get up to on the Web.</p>
                    <p>Join us to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>meet the people who create the Haxian tech you are using</li>
                            <li>connect with other developers who may know a thing or two about Haxe that you don’t</li>
                            <li>get a fresh boost of inspiration and motivation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>And all of that even before the conference party has worked its magic.
                       </p>
                    <p>See you soon!</p>

                                 <p>I'll go through how I, an open-source Haxian who was working on a media player application came to the conclusion that I should build my own embedded database engine. After that bit, I'll move forward explaining why Haxe was the best tool for the job and how it's enabling me to write the engine to be impressively fast/flexible. Closing out, I'll explore how this may be a case study for Haxe's potentially enormous potential within certain categories of development for which it's almost never used.</p>
