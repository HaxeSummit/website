                    <h2>Join us on the Summit!</h2>

                    <p>The US Haxe Summit 2018 is a three day event taking place in Seattle in May 2018. It will be a
                        great opportunity to meet with the US community of Haxe professionals and interested developers.
                        Of course, we will also have international visitors and speakers.</p>

                    <p>If you are currently evaluating Haxe or looking to learn more about it, the conference is a great
                        way to meet people who can answer your questions about the technology.</p>
                    <p>If you are a Haxe developer, you’ll enjoy connecting with the community and getting some fresh
                        ideas, inspiration and learning a few things you didn't know about Haxe yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>The schedule will have a nice mix of talks, workshops and panel discussions. The talks will give
                        you a peek into new and interesting Haxe projects while the workshops will be a good opportunity
                        to get some hands on experience or learn more about tools that you have been curious about.</p>
                    <p>We are looking forward to having you join us in Seattle!</p>

<p>Practice my guitar playing, watch some Netflix and then some reading</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I left Riot Games and started a company that helps Software Engineers be better contractors and freelancers</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Building and shipping a game even if it sucks. Also I want to ship a completely free Haxe video learning series</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I built websites for small businesses</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Code is just a tool. It's a means to solve problems for people. It helps improve peoples lives. I'm not sure if that's philosophical but I think anything we are able to do with the tools we at our disposal should be used to improve things for humans.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is a very flexible tool. You can use the language and the compiler to solve a landscape of problems. Also, it's fun. I was an Actionscript developer for 6-7 years and loved that language. I'm so happy there is something that allows that language to kind of live on.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I built a Flash game for a company called GoNoodle. It was a basic math game for kids that involved encouraging the kids to run in place.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Right now I'm doing a lot of experimentation. I'm trying to use Haxe with UE4 development. Also I've started building desktop applications using HaxeUI and OpenFL.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>

We share our experiences including what went wrong and what went right targeting this diverse set of platforms using an unorthodox combination of Haxe and Unity. This talk should be relevant for anyone interested in doing console game development using Haxe. We will cover both our unusual technical approach as well as our thoughts on what methods might be useful going forward on future cross-platform game projects. Pitfalls unique to console development will be covered in a way that is relevant across a variety of technologies and engine choices. </p>

                        <div><ul><li><strong> What do you do on a Saturday morning? </strong></li></ul>
<p>It really varies! Sunday mornings I usually go for a run, but Saturday mornings I like to be walking around, exploring the city, hiking, or just sleeping in and enjoying brunch with friends if the weather isn't cooperating.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Wednesday night is cooking something interesting for dinner at home or hanging out with friends, either to play board games, discuss books, or go to a talk or show. In the summer it might be an outdoor concert.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I started doing a lot more running with a team here, and that's been a lot of fun.</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe 4.0! I'm also hoping to release one or more online multiplayer games, and looking forward to interacting with the players on them.</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>When I was six years old my mom and I used to type in games from magazines that were printed out in Basic, and save them to tape! There were always typos and bugs, but once we got the game working I would be able to mess around with the code to see what would happen. It was both frustrating as well as a lot of fun. And it led to a lifetime of enjoying programming and creative work.</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>It's clear to me that a lot of the work we do as programmers is repetitive, and therefore ripe for automation. Things like boilerplate code, common idioms, re-specification of the same thing more than once, and structures that we employ in a repeated fashion to facilitate design patterns. Succinct code makes it easier to make changes and correct problems, and removing these repetitive tasks can improve our ability to get things done.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe has a wonderful type system that helps in several ways. First of all, it removes much of one pointless burden from the programmer: the re-specification of types where they are easily implied. When refactoring or changing things, this means fewer conflicts and less writing. Additionally, its support of Abstracts and static imports allows code to be written in a more natural location and can contribute to both readability and type safety, leading to fewer defects.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Dungeon Punks, a console game we released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, PC, and the web in late 2016.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>I'm currently working on a variety of game creation tools and small multiplayer games. I've also recently been using Haxe to create some experimental programming language tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>If you want to write code in an elegant and easy to use language that you'll be able to keep re-using on future projects on practically any platform, there are few good choices other than Haxe. You could use C++, but it's fairly slow to compile, rather painful in terms of cross-platform concerns, and tricky to say the least if you want to run code on the web. You could use Javascript, but it's not highly performant and you might have a tough time porting the runtime to some environments. And there are others you can use for desktop platforms. But for breadth, re-use, and code quality, it's hard to find a language that compares to Haxe.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I would make initialization of member variables consistent across all target platforms, to avoid surprises when running on a new target. (i.e. Float should always start out as the same value regardless of target platform)</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Hard to say... because it always seems to change for the better!</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Just the word "Haxe" is good enough for me!</p><ul><li><strong> Last thoughts: </strong></li></ul>
<p>I've been excited to see Haxe grow and improve every year, and I'm certain this one will be no exception!</p></div>

<p>Even more involvent in development of the compiler.</p>
<p>More rafting.</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I tried to create a game using Qbasic when I was 13, the only source of knowledge i had was built-in docs of MS Dos 6.22. And I failed.

<p>Apart from my full time job and opensource projects I am making a game inspired by tetris, but with "inverted" gameplay: a player can't control falling blocks, but can move bottom bricks. It's amazing how easy it is to create a game which targets mobile platforms, web and desktops using Haxe and OpenFL.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Cross platform battle controller for a game similar to Clash of Clans.

All from the single codebase.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I would improve consistency across targets.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Nothing. I like how Haxe is constantly improved. And if at some point any aspect of Haxe can become better, it should be changed.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>

                                 <p>Remember LAMP -- the Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP web stack? Ahh the (good?) ol’ days. We’ll build a web app on Linux from the ground up with a Node.js backend, Mongo database, and modular HTML5 widgets on the frontend -- all using Haxe. Maybe we’ll throw in SocketIO or Google SSO, just for fun. I’ll showcase a number of handy Haxe macros, components, and best practices I've picked up along the way. </p>

                        <div><ul><li><strong> What do you do on a Saturday morning? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Sleep in... then make a big breakfast for the family! Weekday mornings I usually skip breakfast and just drink coffee. So Saturday breakfasts are special.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Wednesday's are hectic dad mode -- my wife goes to a ladies group, and the kids have various activities. So I'm doing well just to keep everyone alive. "Bonus points" if they're in bed on time. "Epic win" if they took showers, finished homework, and didn't eat ice cream for dinner.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I really enjoy playing piano. I'm not very good at it, but I'm learning, and so in the past (couple) years, I've been making good strides in that. I combine that with my love of technology through the use of a digital keyboard, midi controllers, and virtual instruments. A dream project is to leverage Haxe for scripting audio plugins or even creating virtual instruments.</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I love learning and growing. No matter how much I learn, I’m always finding there’s more to know (The alarming rate at which I forget things maybe contributes to this. Ha!) I think some (perhaps most, perhaps all) people are created with a thirst for learning, for discovering the world and all it’s fascinating systems and designs. Right now I aspire to learn more the Haxe type system, the HL runtime, and other Haxe frameworks and best practices. I want to learn more about music, teaching, parenting, and God’s will for my life. I strive to never consider myself as having “arrived.”</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>When I was about 6 years old, we got a Tandy 1000 SX (16 colors on that beast.) I scoured the local library and magazine rack for BASIC code snippets and really enjoyed the thrill of entering (and tweaking) the programs into the computer. At some point early on, I tried to make a paint program, then fighting and adventure games.</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Ha, I try not to. But my basic philosophy toward coding is to build things that you enjoy and that are useful, and build them quickly. I like to build small, modular, à-la-carte pieces. The simpler the better. I tend to roll my own solutions, for better or worse, as I like to understand how things work. Rapid progress and iteration helps me stay engaged.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is super efficient in a lot of ways: it’s a high-level language with garbage collection, closures, and complex data structures, its type system lets me express code in a self-documenting and future-proof way, the compiler helps me save time by avoiding typos and common mistakes, and of course, the cross-platform targets means that I can leverage code and expertise no matter what I’m working on. All this means I can prototype and build my projects very quickly, without sacrificing the robustness of the codebase.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>One of the first things I built in Haxe was a project called hxScout -- a bit ambitious, looking back! I wanted to be able to profile Haxe C++ applications in the same way I profiled Adobe AIR projects, so it was modeled after Adobe Scout. I didn’t know much about C++ or runtimes, so it was a great learning experience. It was also awesome getting to work closely with Haxians on the hxcpp side like Hugh, Lars, and Sven, as well as Joshua on the OpenFL side. And who can forget mild frustrations vented on the forums, with Juraj and others offering sound advice.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Right now I'm building Woot Math Polls - a real-time polling application focused on the math classroom. It's built with almost 100k lines of Haxe, targeting vanilla JS in the browser. Teachers can run quick polls in their classrooms to gauge student understanding. Polls goes beyond your basic quizzing interfaces -- multiple choice, short answer, real-time feedback -- by providing innovative features for math tasks: graphing, equations, tables, and checking algebraically equivalent answers. The frontend app itself is 100% Haxe, and some backend features are built on Node.js from our Haxe codebase. Other tech we use includes Ruby, Sidekiq, AngularJS, Riot.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is extremely efficient, offering developers the right balance of tools for rapid prototyping, expressiveness, and flexibility, all while preserving maintainable, self-documenting code.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The biggest problem of Haxe is that not enough people use it. I would force more developers and organizations to adopt it <em>smile</em>. But seriously, maybe one of the causes of that is fragmentation. On many levels. The fragmentation of targets is inherent. As are framework and API preferences. There is also a steep learning curve that creates fragmentation of developer skill -- those who deeply understand Haxe and all the capability it provides, and those who just pick it up and want to build something fun. I think something that could help is an extra measure of respect, humility, and grace when interacting with the community. It’s important to realize we’re all enjoying this tool and using it for different purposes and with different experiences. And yet, Haxe must not lose its identity, maintaining a strong and consistent vision, so that there are core principles at the center of our diverse community.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I think that would be the core value of Haxe I mentioned above -- efficiency, expressiveness, flexibility, all while preserving maintainable, self-documenting code. As long as I can do that, Haxe will be my language... err, my weapon of choice.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?).

<p>I really appreciate the Haxe community! Thanks to all the creators, contributors, target maintainers, framework authors, vocal supporters, issue filers, thought leaders, retweeters, and users of the Haxe ecosystem. Thanks to all who have personally helped and worked with me along the way. Cheers!</p></div>

<p>Reading much more</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Building a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game for DOS</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Like spoken languages, I believe that programming allows for communication of ideas and experiences. The best programming language is the one that allows you to do this most naturally.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>As much as possible, I believe that publishing content on multiple platforms should be a business decision -- not a technical one. Haxe has been indispensable for allowing this kind of freedom with a high degree of consistency and quality.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Porting Flash content to Palm webOS</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>I am focused most on helping other people succeed in their work, and it has been really rewarding. Everyone needs a Good Samaritan one time or another!</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>JavaScript is flexible, simple to write and nearly ubiquitous, but it can be hard to optimize -- especially on mobile and embedded platforms. C/C++ is less flexible, and is usually slower to write, but is powerful for optimal performance.</p>
<p>What if you want both?</p>
<p>Haxe provides fast, flexible development with near-ideal performance on all the platforms we need. In fact, the OpenFL project has been used on mobile, desktops, command-line tools, servers, console games, websites, smart TVs, IOT boards and set-top boxes... delivering high-quality projects with less effort.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I would lean into Haxe's potential for being an ideal way to share third-party code, from CommonJS modules to Java JAR files or native shared libraries.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I feel the OpenFL Community of Haxe developers have created a positive and helpful atmosphere that I never want to change.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>

                                 <p>Increasing complexity of requirements leads to more and more applications stringing together multiple different technologies. Here we see a case for a single code base in Haxe for all parts, plus techniques for taking advantage of Haxe's powerful features to prevent locking yourself into any one framework.</p>

                                 <p>Literate programming is an old idea first championed by legendary computer scientist Donald Knuth. Here we will go over how some simple changes you can do to your build process to have literate haxe files, documentation that has functioning code built-into it. We also go over ways to bring literate haxe to the next level with the power of haxe macros.</p>
