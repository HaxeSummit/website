Thomas is a versatile, self-taught programmer who has extensive experience making websites and server-side applications, desktop applications, iOS and Android apps and embedded software. He used his music theory, foreign language and general software versatility to help build two music making games and an app that sings your texts for you and from these efforts has his name on a patent. He is very excited about the possibilities Haxe provides and has used it for many recent side-projects of his. He also makes his own beer, bread and tortillas on a regular basis and occasionally runs his own food booth serving Southern Italian street food.
