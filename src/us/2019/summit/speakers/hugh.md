Hugh has been developing the Hxcpp target and Nme library for over 10 years (with some breaks in between!).  Currently, he is a Senior Developer & Researcher at SplitMediaLabs, developing and implementing real-time video analysis software, and a freelance programmer developing machine learning algorithms for the mining industry.  He likes going for walks in the park and sitting on benchmarks.
