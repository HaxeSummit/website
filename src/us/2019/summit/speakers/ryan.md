I'm a very enthusiastic, passionate software engineer with almost ten years' experience. I've done a lot of web development projects working on both the server-side as well as the front-end stuff, and more recently have branched into more complex and exciting systems-engineering projects. I've been using Haxe avidly for over five years, and have fallen in love with the language.
