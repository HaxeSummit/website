David and Alex are business partners and recent adopters of Haxe. They are currently undertaking a full port of the codebase for their mature cardiology software product. Alex has been coding professionally for 25 years, focusing mostly on development for the Windows desktop. He's a passionate bit twiddler, wading bravely into the tall grass of systems programming, GPU computation, and CPU architectures. David is the co-founder of a medical software company who has been coding in Flash and ActionScript since the mid-90's when they were called FutureSplash and Actions. He is also madly into puppetry, making music, drawing/painting, generative/interactive art, physics, and hanging out with his son.
