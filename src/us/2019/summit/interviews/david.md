* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

household, clearly not the best time of the week

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Watching the last episode of The Magicians

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Speaker at Devoxx was very impressive. And the party in Amsterdam with other Haxians was a little bit like The Hangover, the movie ;)

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Well, after 7 years, I left my job at the beginning of the year. I am now looking for new challenges, something able to excite and to blossom me.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

A text based RPG in Basic on Atari

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. 
Good tools make good workers

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe is a very much better tool than Javascript.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Heidi, a large scale web application to customize products online.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

Sadly, as a web architect i only use haxe on sides projects. I spent my free time coding the hace summit website and code of war, an haxe playground.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

Don't use Haxe. It's such a powerful, robust, pleasant tool that it's could be addictive. Love is a drug and every haxe coder is a junky.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

I would love a better Intellij support and and es6 target.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

The community of course.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

Keep calm and code Haxe

* ** Last thoughts: **

Life should be easier with source code.
