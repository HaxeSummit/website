* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Make pancakes or crepes for the family.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

I spend it wishing it was Thursday night (that's badminton night).

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

I got to be the villain in a play.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Haxe Summit!

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Probably to print "____ is stupid" in an infinite loop on screen.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

I consider the hours I spend using my mind to create code to perform a certain function. I consider how error-prone it is, and how a single wrong character can ruin the whole compile or successful operation. Then I reflect on how DNA is actually code that is insanely more complex and underlies the intricate functions  of life. I am left in awe of what sort of designer must have made it.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe is my language of choice wherever possible. I don't know if it adds to the above insight more than any other language, but it gives me the most enjoyment.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Building a clone of a Flash application for HTML5.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

I am converting a 3D furniture scene builder from Flash into Haxe.  

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

Haxe is ideal for use in browser-based interactivity. 
Regarding the past, it is easy to port old Actionscript or Javascript code.
For the present, it has an excellent compiler and libraries, and integrates seamlessly with whatever external libraries (Javascript or others) you want to use. 
In the future, you will be positioned well to target whatever technologies become widespread, such as WebAssembly.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

Because I don't use Haxe every day, I actually find the addition of new language features to be a bit too rapid for my ability to learn.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

The awesome community!

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

My codebase can beat up your codebase.

* ** Last thoughts: **

I hope they serve Schweinshaxe at the summit.
