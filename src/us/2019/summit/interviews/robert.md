* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

I go to sleep.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

I stare at the Kha IRC chat in utter confusion.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Watching the steady decline of humanity from the comforts of my very cozy office chair.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Talking friends and family into calling me Dr. Konrad and playing more Super Nt.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

It might sound weird even for my standards but my first ever project was an application which analyzed Latin poetry.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Yes, but this was forced on me - I recently played through the "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" game.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Oh, I would sure hope Haxe didn't have anything to do with that.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

It was Kha.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

With Haxe and Kha you can get even the fanciest graphical applications running everywhere - browsers, mobiles, consoles, even inside of other applications - and because it can cross-compile everything, this will continue to be the case, no matter what craziness the IT giants come up with next.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

Optional manual memory management it would be.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

Haxe - If it's good enough for Kha, it's good enough for you
