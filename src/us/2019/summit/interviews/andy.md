* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Gaming if I'm awake...

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Probably also gaming since my girlfriend goes to yoga class every Wednesday night...

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

It is always the people! Meeting the people I know by GitHub/Twitter name in real life was quite an experience.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Hope to meet a bunch of new US-based Haxe users :D

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

An installation art project in which I wrote a program to compute and visualize the geometry of the sculpture before we build the thing. It was written in ActionScript 3.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

I have a background of creative coding since that's what I studied during bachelor degree. I think coding is essentially a generic tool, and it is definitely applicable to creating art. Traditional coding may be unintuitive since we do not have the WYSIWYG experience as in painting, but it doesn't mean coding is not a good painting tool. The generative art creation process is more like an exploration, in which we let the code shows us unexpected results.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

I like how Haxe can be used for very different things. I created some interactive installation and generative graphics with Haxe when I was in University. I built research prototypes and did data analysis with Haxe for my Ph.D. and my current employer. Since it is capable for many things, it let me explore more different areas.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

I ported CASALib, which was a collection of ActionScript utilities, to Haxe. I did that as a way to get familiar with the Haxe language and the standard library.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

I'm more of a Haxe contributor than a user right now. At work, I'm mostly using Python (for deep learning). I've been finding ways to use the Haxe Python target instead but there are still some rough edges (e.g. operator overloading).

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

It is not a single use case, but the most awesome thing is Haxe is good at (almost) every use case.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

Clearer separation of Haxe types and target types like how we have Haxe String vs cpp.NativeString. I think it would be nice to extend this concept to other types like Int, Array, Map, functions etc. It would be easier to write externs.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

That was a hard question... I like most aspects of Haxe but I can see potential improvements in every area. I would keep the C-like syntax since that's what I have settled, but that doesn't mean I want the syntax stay 100% unchanged. Some fine-tuning like the new function type syntax in Haxe 4 is pretty good.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

"Stay sane in cross-platform chaos."

* ** Last thoughts: **

See you in Haxe Summit!
