* ** What was awesome about last year?**

I made Diamond rank in Rocket League

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Getting to Champion rank in Rocket League.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Converting normal text into "l33t sp34k". 8th grade me thought that was super cool.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

When one has finished building one's house, one suddenly realizes that in the process one has learned something that one really needed to know in the worst way - before one began. - Friedrich Nietzsche
Write first, then refactor when it becomes obvious how things should have been written. It's hard to hold yourself to the second part, and even harder to convince your boss, but very much worth it

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

When it becomes obvious I should have been targeting C++ instead of Javascript, I have much less work to do.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

A Pong clone using OpenFL.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

Write once, run anywhere without having to ship - and run - the full chromium runtime with your application. Shame on you, Electron.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

More/better support for functional programming style. Immutable classes, terse syntax for defining functions and chaining function calls, etc. Basically let me write OCaml or F#.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

The t-shirt says "haxe" in faded, vintage-style letters.
