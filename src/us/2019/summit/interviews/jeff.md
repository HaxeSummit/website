* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Sleep in... then make a big breakfast for the family! Weekday mornings I usually skip breakfast and just drink coffee. So Saturday breakfasts are special.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Wednesday's are hectic dad mode -- my wife goes to a ladies group, and the kids have various activities. So I'm doing well just to keep everyone alive. "Bonus points" if they're in bed on time. "Epic win" if they took showers, finished homework, and didn't eat ice cream for dinner.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

I really enjoy playing piano. I'm not very good at it, but I'm learning, and so in the past (couple) years, I've been making good strides in that. I combine that with my love of technology through the use of a digital keyboard, midi controllers, and virtual instruments. A dream project is to leverage Haxe for scripting audio plugins or even creating virtual instruments.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

I love learning and growing. No matter how much I learn, I’m always finding there’s more to know (The alarming rate at which I forget things maybe contributes to this. Ha!) I think some (perhaps most, perhaps all) people are created with a thirst for learning, for discovering the world and all it’s fascinating systems and designs. Right now I aspire to learn more the Haxe type system, the HL runtime, and other Haxe frameworks and best practices. I want to learn more about music, teaching, parenting, and God’s will for my life. I strive to never consider myself as having “arrived.”

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

When I was about 6 years old, we got a Tandy 1000 SX (16 colors on that beast.) I scoured the local library and magazine rack for BASIC code snippets and really enjoyed the thrill of entering (and tweaking) the programs into the computer. At some point early on, I tried to make a paint program, then fighting and adventure games.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Ha, I try not to. But my basic philosophy toward coding is to build things that you enjoy and that are useful, and build them quickly. I like to build small, modular, à-la-carte pieces. The simpler the better. I tend to roll my own solutions, for better or worse, as I like to understand how things work. Rapid progress and iteration helps me stay engaged.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe is super efficient in a lot of ways: it’s a high-level language with garbage collection, closures, and complex data structures, its type system lets me express code in a self-documenting and future-proof way, the compiler helps me save time by avoiding typos and common mistakes, and of course, the cross-platform targets means that I can leverage code and expertise no matter what I’m working on. All this means I can prototype and build my projects very quickly, without sacrificing the robustness of the codebase.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

One of the first things I built in Haxe was a project called hxScout -- a bit ambitious, looking back! I wanted to be able to profile Haxe C++ applications in the same way I profiled Adobe AIR projects, so it was modeled after Adobe Scout. I didn’t know much about C++ or runtimes, so it was a great learning experience. It was also awesome getting to work closely with Haxians on the hxcpp side like Hugh, Lars, and Sven, as well as Joshua on the OpenFL side. And who can forget mild frustrations vented on the forums, with Juraj and others offering sound advice.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

Right now I'm building Woot Math Polls - a real-time polling application focused on the math classroom. It's built with almost 100k lines of Haxe, targeting vanilla JS in the browser. Teachers can run quick polls in their classrooms to gauge student understanding. Polls goes beyond your basic quizzing interfaces -- multiple choice, short answer, real-time feedback -- by providing innovative features for math tasks: graphing, equations, tables, and checking algebraically equivalent answers. The frontend app itself is 100% Haxe, and some backend features are built on Node.js from our Haxe codebase. Other tech we use includes Ruby, Sidekiq, AngularJS, Riot.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

Haxe is extremely efficient, offering developers the right balance of tools for rapid prototyping, expressiveness, and flexibility, all while preserving maintainable, self-documenting code.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

The biggest problem of Haxe is that not enough people use it. I would force more developers and organizations to adopt it *smile*. But seriously, maybe one of the causes of that is fragmentation. On many levels. The fragmentation of targets is inherent. As are framework and API preferences. There is also a steep learning curve that creates fragmentation of developer skill -- those who deeply understand Haxe and all the capability it provides, and those who just pick it up and want to build something fun. I think something that could help is an extra measure of respect, humility, and grace when interacting with the community. It’s important to realize we’re all enjoying this tool and using it for different purposes and with different experiences. And yet, Haxe must not lose its identity, maintaining a strong and consistent vision, so that there are core principles at the center of our diverse community.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

I think that would be the core value of Haxe I mentioned above -- efficiency, expressiveness, flexibility, all while preserving maintainable, self-documenting code. As long as I can do that, Haxe will be my language... err, my weapon of choice.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

* ** Last thoughts: **

I really appreciate the Haxe community! Thanks to all the creators, contributors, target maintainers, framework authors, vocal supporters, issue filers, thought leaders, retweeters, and users of the Haxe ecosystem. Thanks to all who have personally helped and worked with me along the way. Cheers!
