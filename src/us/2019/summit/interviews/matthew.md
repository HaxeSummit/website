* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Code is just a tool. It's a means to solve problems for people. It helps improve peoples lives. I'm not sure if that's philosophical but I think anything we are able to do with the tools we at our disposal should be used to improve things for humans.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe is a very flexible tool. You can use the language and the compiler to solve a landscape of problems. Also, it's fun. I was an Actionscript developer for 6-7 years and loved that language. I'm so happy there is something that allows that language to kind of live on.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

I built a Flash game for a company called GoNoodle. It was a basic math game for kids that involved encouraging the kids to run in place.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

Right now I'm doing a lot of experimentation. I'm trying to use Haxe with UE4 development. Also I've started building desktop applications using HaxeUI and OpenFL.

Filtering badwords for 110,000,000 users.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

More evangelism through more educational content.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

The logo

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

One language to rule them all.
