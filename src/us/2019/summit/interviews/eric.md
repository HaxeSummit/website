* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

These days, I'm working on the Haxe plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Usually the same.  Sunday is my day off when I cook for the family.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Nothing horrible happened.  :)

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

The Haxe Summit.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

A video game, when I was 16 years old.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Any code you write that you feel is clever, or that you are particularly proud of, needs a comment.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Not sure that it does.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Some logging code for TiVo.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

Not sure about that one...

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

Can I get a polo?  With a little logo instead of a crocodile?  Yeah.  That's great.
