# XhX - 10 years of haxe

This talk will cover recent changes to hxcpp in the lead up to haxe version 4, as well as a look at how I got there and where I might be going.  A bit like the Dickensian Christmas Carol, but without the turkey.  And with computers.  Actually, maybe it will be more like Back To The Future, but without the DeLorean.  Or a hoverboard. Well, you get the picture.
