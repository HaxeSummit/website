# Building Giffon with Serverless and Haxe

"It is an experience sharing session on the journey of building Giffon, a crowd-gifting platform where you can state what you want and let your friends collectively buy it as a gift for you.

I will describe how did I wire up services (Stripe, Amazon, Facebook etc.) and programming tools (MySQL, HTML/JS, Node, Python etc.) with Haxe and got it running on AWS Lambda."
