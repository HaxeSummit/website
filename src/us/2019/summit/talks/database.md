# The Untapped Potential of Haxe: Why I'm Building a Database Engine Using Pure-Haxe

I'll go through how I, an open-source Haxian who was working on a media player application came to the conclusion that I should build my own embedded database engine. After that bit, I'll move forward explaining why Haxe was the best tool for the job and how it's enabling me to write the engine to be impressively fast/flexible. Closing out, I'll explore how this may be a case study for Haxe's potentially enormous potential within certain categories of development for which it's almost never used.
