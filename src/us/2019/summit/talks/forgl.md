# forGL: Any Language Does Computer Programming

forGL is an application that allows people to program computers without knowing English OR Programming. English knowledge is OK also :)
Will show demo, screen shots, some talk of approaches used, future directions.
Words in their own language are edited in a Dictionary and then run as a program with output and debugging. European languages supported now. More languages perhaps by May.
