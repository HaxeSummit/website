# Building Haxe/OpenFL Native Extensions for iOS and Android

One of the many advantages of Haxe is that it makes it easy to target multiple platforms with your code. Most mobile games, however, need to integrate 3rd party native extensions for things like IAP, analytics, ads, crash reporting and other business critical features using Haxe native extensions. Writing Haxe native extensions can be complicated, especially for developers who don't have native development experience. This talk is meant to help make it easier for developers to write their own native extensions.
