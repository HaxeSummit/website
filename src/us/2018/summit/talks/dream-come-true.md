# Haxe: A dream-come-true for browser interactivity

I am a graphic and multimedia designer who became heavily invested in Flash then found a dream-come-true in Haxe when it became apparent that Flash would die. This presentation will be designed to whet the appetites of those people considering Haxe for browser-based interactivity, and show how it is a solid investment. I will present examples of different real-world projects done over nine years using different display methods including OpenFL, OpenLayers, EaselJS, DOM/CSS and SVG. I will explain the rationale in choosing the technologies for each solution, and discuss the process of doing Flash-to-Haxe conversion, dual-compiled interactive pieces, and working with external Javascript libraries. I will describe some of the options for IDEs today and my preferred development toolkit, and my perceived advantages of using Haxe going into the future.
