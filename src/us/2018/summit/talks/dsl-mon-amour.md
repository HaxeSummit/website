# DSL, mon amour!

DSLs are small languages, focused on a particular aspect of your software system. You can't build a whole program with a DSL, but you often use multiple DSLs in a system mainly written in a general purpose language.

This presentation is split in 3 parts presenting:

- Advantages to use internal/external DSLs instead of traditional libraries to improve programmer productivity and communication between team members.
- Case study of a real world DSL able to be parsed/executed at runtime and compile time.
- How to use Haxe language features to develop powerful DSL toolchain with different grammars and code generation.

Who is this presentation for:

Itâ€™s targeted to every developer who wants to have a nice introduction about DSL power in the application world, and have a first taste of Haxe macros black magic.
