# Better stacks with Haxe: Let’s build a web app from the ground up

Remember LAMP -- the Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP web stack? Ahh the (good?) ol’ days. We’ll build a web app on Linux from the ground up with a Node.js backend, Mongo database, and modular HTML5 widgets on the frontend -- all using Haxe. Maybe we’ll throw in SocketIO or Google SSO, just for fun. I’ll showcase a number of handy Haxe macros, components, and best practices I've picked up along the way.
