# Console Punks: Haxe and Games for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, the Web, and Beyond

In late 2016 we released "Dungeon Punks" on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Steam, and the Web. We share our experiences including what went wrong and what went right targeting this diverse set of platforms using an unorthodox combination of Haxe and Unity. This talk should be relevant for anyone interested in doing console game development using Haxe. We will cover both our unusual technical approach as well as our thoughts on what methods might be useful going forward on future cross-platform game projects. Pitfalls unique to console development will be covered in a way that is relevant across a variety of technologies and engine choices.
