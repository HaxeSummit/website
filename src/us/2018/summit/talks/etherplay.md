# Etherplay : Using Haxe For Games And The Web3 Stack

[Etherplay](http://etherplay.io) is a skill game platform that use [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) to provide transparency and other benefit to our players.

Haxe had a very important place in building the platform. Its type safety and macro helped us in many ways and we would like to share how it helped us and what we build with it. We use Haxe both for our backend where it interact with Ethereum and for our games running on the web. In both case, Haxe was our friend and we have few tools/lib that might interest the audience.
