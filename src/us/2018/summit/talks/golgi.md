# Golgi : Fast cross platform routing and dispatch

Golgi is a routing library that is geared for speed and composability. 
Golgi uses a macro-generated class interface as a route dispatch table.  
Rather than writing complex global route patterns, simply start writing a standard class that extends Golgi, and enjoy extremely fast routing and flexible composition for all your routing needs.
