Eric has enjoyed overseeing the development of the Haxe Toolkit plugin for IntelliJ IDEA for the past four years.  The decades before that have found him working in all manner of products, from GIS databases, to cell phone standards, to family-oriented hand-held game systems and TiVo DVRs.  Along the way, he has worked at every level of the software stack from device drivers to UI.
