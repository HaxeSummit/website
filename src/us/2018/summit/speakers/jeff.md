Jeff is a Co-Founder and Principal Engineer at Woot Math. He loves Haxe because heâ€™s lazy, impatient, and forgetful -- that is, he appreciates the benefits of a cross-platform, efficient, type-safe language like Haxe. Woot Math adopted Haxe about 3 years ago and now uses almost 100k lines of Haxe code to implement a market-leading real-time polling app for the Math classroom.
