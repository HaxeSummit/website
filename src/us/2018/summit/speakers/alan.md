Trained as a graphic designer, Allan has been working with print and multimedia since 1995. After a job as a Flash programmer he began his own freelance company, Confidant Communications, to achieve a better balance between right and left-brain work. Haxe has been part of his toolkit since 2009 and he uses it as much as possible whenever interactivity or animation is required.
