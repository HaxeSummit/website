Dan has been having fun with programming since he was seven, and is still enjoying it. He’s gone from web development in Python, through Flash/AS3 to game development using C# and Haxe. He seriously fell in love with Haxe and uses it to the max for his everyday work. He actively contributes to open-source tools he’s using, so Haxe became the main target of his open-source work.
