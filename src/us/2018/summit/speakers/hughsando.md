By day, Hugh works on machine vision, and by night he works his vision on a machine, writing the hxcpp haxe target. Find him on twitter [@GameHaxe](https://twitter.com/GameHaxe), where he ponders the mysteries of this universe as he tries to work out how to use git. Hugh has been programming with Haxe for over 7 years and is the primary contributor to the c++ back-end. He has also made significant contributions to the Nme, Waxe and Gm2d libraries.
