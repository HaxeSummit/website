* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Falconry

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Exploring the vast reaches of our ocean floor in a homemade submersible

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Secretly saving the world from certain doom

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Picking up knitting

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Implementing a GUI interface in Visual Basic to track the killer's IP address

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Always pay attention to the ugliest code you're ever forced to write.  You've just run into an opportunity to expand the language.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe doesn't make too many hard constraints on the underlying runtime, or on how types are defined syntactically.  If I run into a problem with conventional typing/syntax, I generally have good options between abstracts and build/init macros.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

A small visualization project that replaced an actionscript codebase.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

I'm currently working on Golgi, which is a new take on an age-old routing problem.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

A haxe project that compiled js code for backend and frontend, and then js code for running phantom js which emulated a browser running js and loading the site.  One build command was able to compile every change, functionally test the code live in our website, and compare a screenshot of the page to a known good result.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

Some parts of the standard libraries are still based off of flash apis from years ago.  Time to migrate to something more haxe-ish I think.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

Our community is great, and I feel we keep the drama to a bare minimum.  Gotta hang onto that.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.

* ** Last thoughts: **

As a Seattle native, looking forward to having you guys in my neighborhood!
