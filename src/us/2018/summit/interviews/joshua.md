* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Reading a book aloud to my wife

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Taking the kids out for a walk

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Our new baby Matthew was born!

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Reading much more

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Building a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game for DOS

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Like spoken languages, I believe that programming allows for communication of ideas and experiences. The best programming language is the one that allows you to do this most naturally.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

As much as possible, I believe that publishing content on multiple platforms should be a business decision -- not a technical one. Haxe has been indispensable for allowing this kind of freedom with a high degree of consistency and quality.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Porting Flash content to Palm webOS

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

I am focused most on helping other people succeed in their work, and it has been really rewarding. Everyone needs a Good Samaritan one time or another!

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

JavaScript is flexible, simple to write and nearly ubiquitous, but it can be hard to optimize -- especially on mobile and embedded platforms. C/C++ is less flexible, and is usually slower to write, but is powerful for optimal performance.

What if you want both?

Haxe provides fast, flexible development with near-ideal performance on all the platforms we need. In fact, the OpenFL project has been used on mobile, desktops, command-line tools, servers, console games, websites, smart TVs, IOT boards and set-top boxes... delivering high-quality projects with less effort.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

I would lean into Haxe's potential for being an ideal way to share third-party code, from CommonJS modules to Java JAR files or native shared libraries.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

I feel the OpenFL Community of Haxe developers have created a positive and helpful atmosphere that I never want to change.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**
