* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

I generally wake up around 4am. Time for a long breakfast with fruits and cereals. Black coffee as a moonless night. I need to wake up my brain, to be able to connect my fingers with the piano. Yeah, I write music, and if the weather is not a total disaster, I take time to have a walk with a podcast in my headphones.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Nothing particular, I just avoid to eat after 12 to keep my Gizmo spirit.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

I freed my mind from 2 years of slavery. Be back to music helped a lot. Ghosts are gone now. Blow with the wind.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

To meet my best friend in France in her new apartment. The main party will be in my heart.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Nothing fancy. It was a program for latin declinations. I didn't have a computer at this time. I did it on the Apple II of my college. Around 35 years ago now.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Just an utopy, like in my own life: Get freedom and remove dependencies.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe is my new girlifriend, till AS3 left with the kids, and all the other ones didn't bring so much love when darkness rushed in my life. I still remember when for the 1st time she told me: "Do you want to play with macros?". Till this time, love never stopped, and light came back to my world.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

A unit-test framework, that I wrote previously in typescript, just the week before. Was a nice exercise to discover the basics.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

It's called hexMachina, it's a community project, an architectural framework born in 2003/2004 (in AS2). I work on it daily and we use it at Docler as a foundation for one of our products.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

I think it was when I realized that I could create my own DSL, a compile time DSL (oh man!) that could even describe itself. Like many developers, I was fascinated by getting some tools to create my own domain language. Haxe gave to me this opportunity, and much more than I could expect... When a general purpose language is capable to redesign itself, it gives you a taste of infinity. Haxe reconciled me to programming.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

Reliable compiler services, and bring back Simn from Zelda's world.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

Macros. It's one of the best tools ever made. It pushed me to explore other languages that offers this feature, it's so powerful !

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

Last night Haxe saved my life

* ** Last thoughts: **

I feel really excited to come to Seattle, to meet the american community and in a broad manner to connect IRL with the whole community. The best think that haxe got is its community.
