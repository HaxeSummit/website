* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

It really varies! Sunday mornings I usually go for a run, but Saturday mornings I like to be walking around, exploring the city, hiking, or just sleeping in and enjoying brunch with friends if the weather isn't cooperating.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Wednesday night is cooking something interesting for dinner at home or hanging out with friends, either to play board games, discuss books, or go to a talk or show. In the summer it might be an outdoor concert.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

I started doing a lot more running with a team here, and that's been a lot of fun.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Haxe 4.0! I'm also hoping to release one or more online multiplayer games, and looking forward to interacting with the players on them.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

When I was six years old my mom and I used to type in games from magazines that were printed out in Basic, and save them to tape! There were always typos and bugs, but once we got the game working I would be able to mess around with the code to see what would happen. It was both frustrating as well as a lot of fun. And it led to a lifetime of enjoying programming and creative work.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

It's clear to me that a lot of the work we do as programmers is repetitive, and therefore ripe for automation. Things like boilerplate code, common idioms, re-specification of the same thing more than once, and structures that we employ in a repeated fashion to facilitate design patterns. Succinct code makes it easier to make changes and correct problems, and removing these repetitive tasks can improve our ability to get things done.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe has a wonderful type system that helps in several ways. First of all, it removes much of one pointless burden from the programmer: the re-specification of types where they are easily implied. When refactoring or changing things, this means fewer conflicts and less writing. Additionally, its support of Abstracts and static imports allows code to be written in a more natural location and can contribute to both readability and type safety, leading to fewer defects.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Dungeon Punks, a console game we released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, PC, and the web in late 2016.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

I'm currently working on a variety of game creation tools and small multiplayer games. I've also recently been using Haxe to create some experimental programming language tools.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

If you want to write code in an elegant and easy to use language that you'll be able to keep re-using on future projects on practically any platform, there are few good choices other than Haxe. You could use C++, but it's fairly slow to compile, rather painful in terms of cross-platform concerns, and tricky to say the least if you want to run code on the web. You could use Javascript, but it's not highly performant and you might have a tough time porting the runtime to some environments. And there are others you can use for desktop platforms. But for breadth, re-use, and code quality, it's hard to find a language that compares to Haxe.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

I would make initialization of member variables consistent across all target platforms, to avoid surprises when running on a new target. (i.e. Float should always start out as the same value regardless of target platform)

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

Hard to say... because it always seems to change for the better!

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

Just the word "Haxe" is good enough for me!

* ** Last thoughts: **

I've been excited to see Haxe grow and improve every year, and I'm certain this one will be no exception!
