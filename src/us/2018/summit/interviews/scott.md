* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

I go to a coffee shop with my wife, child, and baby.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

I put my kids to bed and then play Super Nintendo games.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

My second daughter was born and then we took her to see a total solar eclipse.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Spending a week in Kauai!

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

I programmed in Logo to make turtle graphics and control LEGO robots.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

When it comes to code, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  There are so many aesthetic, structural, and naming choices available that it is rare to find people who entirely agree with each other.  Our best hope is that we can at least tolerate each other's code :)

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Porting our hit game Vegas World from ActionScript to Haxe.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

We are still developing Vegas World in Haxe.  It is a virtual world with social interaction, parties, and gambling games.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

We use Haxe because it is an open source platform which allows us to target HTML5 and native mobile from a single codebase.  Haxe lines up closely with Actionscript which allowed the porting of our project rather than the a complete re-write which would have been required had we chosen a different platform.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

I would add the ability to compile and debug native iOS from a Windows PC.
