* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Play with the kids, mostly.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Put the kids to bed, do some reading, try to get to bed early.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Not a lot, it was a difficult year personally.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Finally shipping all the stuff that I've been working on for years.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Little QBASIC games in sixth grade.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

I got bitten hard by being locked into a proprietary technology with Flash.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

It appeals to me that it's open source, and also that it's so cross platform. It's a very versatile tool and I like the freedom.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

Porting Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten from Flash to native desktop platforms.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

Working on Defender's Quest II! Taking everything I've learned and improving on it, and reaching new platforms.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

Write a game, have it running in HTML5, on desktop, on mobile, and consoles, with full source access to the entire tech stack.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

More developers, larger community.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

Maybe the logo, it's pretty cool.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

"Haxe"

* ** Last thoughts: **

:)
