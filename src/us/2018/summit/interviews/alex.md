* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Usualy I go somewhere with my family. Also I'd love to sleep, but that's not an easy task if your children wake up early.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Most likely you will find me coding on Wednesday night. Recently I started to play boardgames. And sometimes I sit in a bar.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

Haxe Summit in Amsterdam!
My involvement in development of the Haxe compiler.
Rafting on catamarans in Karelia.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

My daughter's first day at school.
Haxe Summit in Seattle!
Even more involvent in development of the compiler.
More rafting.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

I tried to create a game using Qbasic when I was 13, the only source of knowledge i had was built-in docs of MS Dos 6.22. And I failed. But somehow I managed to create a primitive drawing app.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Nope. I just try to keep my code clean and easy to read and understand.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe allows me to create expressive yet concise code.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

It was an interactive flash menu for a fan site of some spanish singer in 2007

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

Apart from my full time job and opensource projects I am making a game inspired by tetris, but with "inverted" gameplay: a player can't control falling blocks, but can move bottom bricks. It's amazing how easy it is to create a game which targets mobile platforms, web and desktops using Haxe and OpenFL.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

Cross platform battle controller for a game similar to Clash of Clans. I created swc lib for actionscript-based web client, shared library for c++ ios and android clients and a php lib for the game server. All from the single codebase.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

I would improve consistency across targets.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

Nothing. I like how Haxe is constantly improved. And if at some point any aspect of Haxe can become better, it should be changed.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

"HAXE. BLOW YOUR MIND". And I already have one) But I wear it just a couple of days a month, and it says just "Haxe".

* ** Last thoughts: **

Haxe is great!
