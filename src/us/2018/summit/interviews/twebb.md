* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Probably getting the kids ready for one of our weekend adventures.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

Reading my kids a bedtime story, then afterward I might work on a hobby that can be done when I'm sleepy like starting the process of making a loaf of bread, making tortillas for later, etc.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild coming out and also personally, getting settled into a new place. Also closing it off with being in Japan for almost a month and being able to work remotely while doing so.

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

Two huge road trips, finishing one of my major projects and one of my batches of mead finally maturing enough to be drinkable.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Probably adding javascript for effects on a web page in my late teens. Other early contenders are using basic on my graphing calculator to cheat in math class (writing simple programs to do all the work for me) and a command-line application to quiz me in vocabulary when I was studying German, written in C.

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

Coding is like writing. No, coding is writing. But it must be readable by two audiences - humans and computers. The principles that apply to good writing, such as clarity and berevity, apply to coding. In the interest of allowing humans to understand what you wrote, you need to know when to tell the whole story depth first or when to give a reader's digest, allowing them to look up details in the function if they wish.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Haxe is a modern object-oriented language with modern features that encourages encapsulation. While it has dynamic targets, it's type safety at compile-time allows you to be clear about what a thing is and avoid the plague of unclear writing, bad analogies.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

I made a game for toddlers using OpenFL in under a month, which you can get in the app store (Zany Faces).

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

Currently, I am working on a minimalistic horror hack and slash RPG I'm making and a 2D RPG/Visual novel engine for it.

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

If you have a complex client/server application in haxe, you can share the code between server and client without having to be married to a certain framework. If you like Xamarin for the client but want js on the server, you can write the common code (or, indeed, all of the code) in haxe. You can make the choice of where to run some parts of the code based on performance considerations without having to rewrite too much code.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

It would be self-hosting (haxe written in haxe). Bonus if it worked with any of the targets (so you could even have a js runtime compile haxe code if need be).

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

The flexibility you have in unifying types and being able to specify an anonymous structure as the type.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

Front: Haxe: writes in javascript, so you don't have to. Back: a source listing of how a simple hello world program transpiles to various targets

* ** Last thoughts: **

Haxe is amazing technology and it needs some basic infrastructure like better IDE support to start finding greater adoption in other niches than gaming. I'm confident it will get there in the next few years.
