* ** What do you do on a Saturday morning? **

Usually I wake up early with some exciting new thing I want to code.

* ** How about Wednesday night? **

I often watch a movie.

* ** What was awesome about last year?**

The Haxe Summit ! - And Northgard Early access that was very well received

* ** What are you looking forward to this year?**

The Haxe Summit ! - And looking forward to reception of my newest games.

* ** What is the first thing you ever used coding for?**

Making games

* ** Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:**

DRY KISS are two important concepts. "Beautiful code is not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to remove."
Syntax is mostly irrelevant and way too much time is spent discussing about it, whereas what is very important is semantic.

* ** How does Haxe come into that?**

Macros helps a lot creating nicer APIs and carrying developer will into the final code.

* ** What was your first Haxe project?**

trace("Hello World"); I guess that was actually the first Haxe Project ever :) It took a bit of time to get it working correctly, back in the days.

* ** Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:**

It's not yet announced so I can't tell much about it yet. It's a cool game :)

* **Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:**

With Haxe you can develop your desktop application, your server, you front and back end, your web and mobiles apps. With one single code base.

* ** If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?**

I would have worked on HashLink before.

* ** If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?**

The fact that it's very easy to get started, yet has a nice learning curve to become a better developer.

* ** You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (letâ€™s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:**

There's a macro for it!

* ** Last thoughts: **

See you at Haxe Summit!
