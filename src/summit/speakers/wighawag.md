Ronan has been developing games professionally for more than 7 years, but he has always played with many parts of the dev stack (server, client and now blockchain, smart contract). Haxe has been with him since that time too, however it is only last year when Ronan co-founded Etherplay that he could start using it full time. He uses it for games, backend and now communicating with Ethereum.
