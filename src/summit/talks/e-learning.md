# Using haxe to build an e-learning framework

In the talk Iâ€™ll discuss how we used haxe to create a model-driven, future proof framework. Our framework is build with haxe and allows us to create custom made e-learning solutions.
I like to discuss 3 main aspects of this framework and how haxe helped us establishing them.

1. Model driven architecture
2. High structural and visual flexibility
3. Minimal language (haxe-target) dependencies
