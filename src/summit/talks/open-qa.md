# Open Q&A with the team

Wanna know Nicolas' vision for Haxe's future? Or how Simn manages not to go crazy? Or Hugh's favorite coding playlist? Or how Andy can summon the diligence to maintain Haxe's CI? Or what Fiene thinks we could do to get out of our nerdy niche? Or something else entirely? Well then, ask away!
