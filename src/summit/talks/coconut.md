# Model, View ... Coconut!

MVCoconut is the UI framework nobody ever asked for or heard about. It sports:

- simple, yet ridiculously powerful declarative bindings without compromising on type safety
- a (fully optional) robust model layer
- support for web based and native UIs
- a migration path that makes it possible to gradually integrate it within existing codebases 

We'll take it for a spin around the block.
