    <h2>Join us on the Summit!</h2>

    <p>The Haxe Summit 2017 is a four day conference for Haxe professionals to connect with one another as well as the authors of the tools they are actively using or considering to add to their toolchain.</p>

    <p>We are putting together a schedule with two separate tracks for game and web development. It will be packed with hands on tutorials and workshop, panel discussions covering various aspects of Haxe and of course a wide selection of talks to improve visibility of all the things going on within Haxe's busy ecosystem.</p>

            <p>
              Tamina is a fast, small, and feature-rich haxe library.
              It makes things like Web Components, Custom Elements, Event handling, Proxy, Assets Loading, i18n, and XHR much simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by AngularJS and Flex frameworks, Tamina is a low level toolset for building large scaled web applications. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.

              <h3>DSL mon amour</h3>
              <p>DSLs are small languages, focused on a particular aspect of your software system. You can't build a whole program with a DSL, but you often use multiple DSLs in a system mainly written in a general purpose language.</p>
<p>This presentation is splitted in 3 parts presenting:</p><ul><li>Advantages to use internal/external DSLs instead of traditional libraries to improve programmer productivity and communication between team members.</li><li>Case study of a real world DSL able to be parsed/executed at runtime and compile time.</li><li>How to use Haxe language features to develop powerful DSL toolchain with different grammars and code generation.</li></ul>
<p>Who is this presentation for:</p>
<p>It’s targeted to every developer who wants to have a nice introduction about DSL power in the application world, and have a first taste of Haxe macros black magic.</p>

years, but he has always played with many parts of the dev stack (server,
client and now blockchain, smart contract). Haxe has been with him since

could start using it full time. He uses it for games, backend and now

              <p>
            <a href="http://etherplay.io">Etherplay</a> is a skill game platform that uses <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> to provide transparency and other benefits to our players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Haxe had a very important place in building the platform. Its type safety and macros proved instrumental on many occasions and we would like to share how it helped us and what we build with it. We use Haxe both for our backend where it interacts with Ethereum and for our games running on the web. In both cases, Haxe was our friend and we have a few tools/lib that might interest the audience.
